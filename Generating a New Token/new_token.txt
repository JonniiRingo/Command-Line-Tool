Navigate to Personal Access Tokens:


In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile photo.

Click Settings.

Scroll down to the Developer settings section in the sidebar (found at the bottom of 

the settings page).

Click Personal access tokens, then Tokens (classic).

Generate a New Token:

Click the Generate new token button.

You will be prompted to enter a Note (optional but helpful to identify the token's 

purpose, e.g., "GitHub CLI Token").

Select the Expiration date for the token, such as 30 days, 60 days, etc. You can 

leave this as "No expiration," but shorter expiration dates are recommended for security.

Select the Necessary Scopes:

To allow full Git operations, check the following scopes:

repo (Full control of private repositories)

read:org (Read access to organization memberships)

You can select additional scopes depending on your needs, such as workflow if you work with GitHub Actions, but repo and read:org are generally enough for most purposes.

Generate the Token:

Scroll to the bottom and click Generate token.

IMPORTANT: Youâ€™ll only see the token once, so copy it immediately. If you forget to copy it, you'll need to generate a new token.

Store Your Token:

Safely store your token somewhere you can retrieve it when needed. Avoid leaving it in publicly accessible places.

How to Use Your Token with GitHub CLI

Login to GitHub CLI:

In your terminal, run:

bash

Copy code

gh auth login

When prompted, select GitHub.com and choose SSH as your protocol for Git operations.

When asked how you want to authenticate, choose Paste an authentication token.

Paste the newly generated token.

Verify Authentication:

Run the following to check your authentication status:

bash

Copy code

gh auth status

This will confirm that you are logged in and show the token scopes.
